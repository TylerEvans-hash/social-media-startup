# The Social Media Startup

## Purpose
This project is to show my knowledge and understanding of making an application that is deployed to Heroku with MongoDB Atlas. This API is to be used for a social media app that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends posts, and create a friends list.

## Goals for the Project ( User Story )

AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## The Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
